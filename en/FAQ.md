# DiversiFAQ: Questions and answers about diversity in technology

### What benefits has a diverse team?

The software we develop inherits our biases. There are many [documented cases](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/13/ai-programs-exhibit-racist-and-sexist-biases-research-reveals) about this.

Diverse teams diminish the impact of this biases in the final product, and are also more resolutive and innovative.

### There is little diversity because members of underrepresented groups are not interested in the profession.

The cultural, social or economic circumstances of an individual determine to a large extent their future and how they will be educated. The choice of a hobby or profession is guided by the polarization of education or the existence of stereotypes and biases. That is to say, the interest exists but there are many obstacles along a person's life path.

### Members of underrepresented groups do not respond to our job offers or *call for papers*.

Issues such as impostor syndrome, stereotypes or lack of
representation influence when members of sector minorities decide to apply for employment, be active in a community or present a talk.

Part of the responsibility of the company, community or event with diversity
is the active search for these individuals: not just by contacting
them, but also creating a secure environment in which they can develop
academically and / or professionally with normality.

### What is the formula to make my company/event/community a diverse space?

There is no magic recipe. Each company, event or community has specific needs that must be studied and addressed individually.

There are, however, some general actions that we can carry out: writing and using codes of conduct, offering training and related resources or creating representative bodies of underrepresented groups within the community.

The promotion of diversity and inclusion is a complex and transversal task, that is why it is important to have experts in the field who can guide us and offer us the plan that best fits our needs.

### What can I do as an individual for inclusion and diversity in technology?

Making technology a safe space is everyone's responsibility, so there are many individual actions we can take to change the culture of the guild and make it a welcoming place: from receiving training related to actively participating in associations that lead to out campaigns for inclusion.

### We want to facilitate and encourage the attendance of underrepresented groups to our event, is it enough to reserve tickets for them?

Depending on the characteristics of your event, reserving tickets will be a very useful proposition or an unfortunate move.

It is important to analyze what barriers you have to overcome. Is it a free event? Then booking tickets can be a good idea. Is it, on the contrary, a payment event? Perhaps the best option is to sponsor entries.
